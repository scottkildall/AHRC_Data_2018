DATA PLACE
(working title) 
------------------------


Data
————————————
Are all located in the Data directory:


—> consolidated_master is the master db, which we export to CSV from Numbers

Put a COPY of it in Mac_Shared and transfer it to the Win machine. Mac always holds the master DB.

Each line of consolidated_master will correspond to a single object and contains
	** a unique ID number
	** country name (common name)
	** data: which data element this represents
	** value: a value that corresponds to that data (units vary per dataset)
		** Fossil Fuels and Metal Ores are in Tonnes (from the UN database)
		** Carbon is carbon emissions in tons (I think) per capita

	** mesh: the name of a mesh that corresponds to that data (ie we have about 6 different mesh types), which is an FBX file
	** flag material: the name of a material in Unreal that we make manually from the flag texture
	** lon, lat: longitude and latitude of the country’s capital
	** x, y, z: x, y and z values for where the mesh with be spawned. This is translated via a Python script from lat, lon


moshed_flags is the directory which contain all textures for the flags. 

countries_data is the directory which contains individual datasets for each country that I have copied maually into the consolidated_master, they are:

** UN_Exports_xyz_current: adaptation of the UN databases. We are just copying out the Metal Ores & Fossil Fuels
	provided by the United Nations

** carbonemissios: carbon emissions per capita
	not sure where this was provided

** active_military: % of active military
	
** population: absolute number of people
